### Disclosure

Everything is handmade, and will have imperfections. Colors may vary slightly on screen. 

It is not recommended to wear ears on water rides due to the cardboard interior. 


### Product Buy & Delivery Policy

Please allow 14 days for product production and shipping, especially for custom orders. I collect a local and state sales tax of 8.7%, please refer to [here](https://www.avalara.com/taxrates/en/state-rates/arizona/cities/tucson.html#:~:text=The%20minimum%20combined%202023%20sales,sales%20tax%20rate%20is%200%25.) if you have concerns. 

### Refund Policy

I do not issue refunds, returns or exchanges because items are specially designed. If you have issues with your order, you can message me and we can try to come to a resolution.
