Blanket yarn, crocheted to make a soft beanie. Crochet items are made by hand, and no machine can replicate the work. Hours are put into each piece to ensure the quality. Newborn size is made to fit 0-6 month olds comfortably.

Two ears are placed on top to create a cute bear look. **Colors include gold and birch**.

Please indicate desired color in the comment section at checkout. If no color is designated, you will receive whatever color is currently on hand.

Care: hand wash item and lay flat to dry
