Velvet yarn, crocheted to make a soft beanie. Crochet items are made by hand, and no machine can replicate the work. Hours are put into each piece to ensure the quality. 

**Sizes available**:

**Newborn** size is made to fit 0-6 month olds comfortably (**price: $30**). 

**Child** size is made to comfortably fit 4 year olds (**Price: $40**). 

**Adult** size is made to fit most adults.

Please indicate desired size in the drop-down at checkout. If no size is designated, you will receive adult sizing.

Two faux-fur poms are placed on either side of the beanie to create a cute ear effect. **Colors include quiet pink and soft blue**. 

Please indicate desired size and color in the comment section at checkout. If no color is designated, you will receive whatever color is currently on hand.
