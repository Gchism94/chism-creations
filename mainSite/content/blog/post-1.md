My name is Tressa Chism, and I am a licensed Speech-Language Pathologist working for a school system in Arizona. Originally, I am from northern California, but I moved to Arizona with my husband in 2019. Besides my students, my other love is all things Disney. I had the privilege to hold an annual pass to Disneyland a year during my graduate schooling at Loma Linda University. That year, I was Disney bound EVERY weekend, where I would sometimes just sit and listen to the noises of Disney and admired everyoneâ€™s amazing themed outfits. 

I started creating mouse ears in 2021, but could not help thinking of my students with sensory needs. My students with noise sensitivities would not be able to wear both headbands and their noise canceling headphones. My solution was Quiet Ears! Quiet Ears would allow those with noise sensitivities to take part in the simple pleasure of wearing mouse ears to Disney. Let's strive to make Disney #inclusionbound with Quiet Ears!
