My name is Tressa Chism, and I am a licensed Speech-Language Pathologist working for a school system in Arizona. Originally, I am from northern California where I got my degree, and moved to Arizona with my husband in 2019. Besides my students, my other love is all things Disney. I had the privilege to hold an annual pass to Disneyland for the year during my Graduate Schooling. That year, I was Disneybound EVERY weekend. Some days I would go just to sit and listen to the noises of Disney and admire everyone’s amazing themed outfits. 

I started creating mouse ears in 2021, but could not help thinking of my students with sensory needs. My students with noise sensitivities would not be able to wear headbands while wearing noise canceling headphones. That is when I created Quiet Ears! Quiet Ears would allow those with noise sensitivities to take part in the simple pleasure of wearing mouse ears to Disney. Let's strive to make Disney #inclusionbound with Quiet Ears!
