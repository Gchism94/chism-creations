Disney bounding is a substantial part of the Disney culture. Decorative headbands and flashy outfits make us feel that we are a part of the magic. All dressed up, we strut through the parks as the joyous noises wash over us; but not everyone thinks the noises of Disney are beautiful. To some, these noises cause great discomfort and they wear noise canceling headphones instead of character headbands.  

Let's be #inclusionbound with Quiet Ears! Adaptive headphone attachments for Disney lovers! Quiet Ears are mouse ears you attach to headphones, allowing those with noise sensitivities to enjoy the Disney bounding.
